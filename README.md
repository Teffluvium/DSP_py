# DSP_py
Digital signal processing codes implemented in Python 3

butterworth_filter.py:
Requires Python 3, Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.
Applies a butterworth filter to low-pass filter a simulated sinusoidal
signal. Outputs plots of the simulated sigmal and its frequency 
spectrum before and after filtering.

frequency_interactive.py:
Interactive illustration of the relationship between a sine-wave's frequency and it's Fourier transfrom.
Recommend using Visual Studio Code or other IDE that supports Jupyter-like code cells. For documentation on Visual Studio Code, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py#_jupyter-code-cells.
Requirements: ipywidgets, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and Jupyter. The code runs in a Jupyter-like code cells within Python code defined with a # %% comment.
Click Run Cell. Interactive plot opens in an interactive window. Move the frequency slider at the top of the interactive plot and watch the sine wave frequency and the Fourier transform plots change simultaneously.
